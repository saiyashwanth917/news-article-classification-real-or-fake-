# news-article-classification-real-or-fake-
This project focuses on classifying news articles as fake or real using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed by removing stopwords and punctuation, then vectorized using TF-IDF. A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the balanced dataset to prevent prediction bias. The model achieved high accuracy and balanced performance for both classes. Finally, a simple text input interface allows users to test news articles for authenticity, enabling real-time prediction. This project demonstrates how machine learning can help fight misinformation in media.
