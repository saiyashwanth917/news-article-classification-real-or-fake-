**📰 Fake News Detection using NLP:**



🔸This project aims to build a machine learning model that can classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing techniques. Using a labeled dataset collected from Kaggle, we preprocess the text with NLTK (removing stopwords, stemming, etc.), convert it into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization, and train a Logistic Regression model. The model is then deployed using Streamlit, providing a simple user interface where anyone can input a news statement and get an instant prediction. This helps demonstrate how machine learning can assist in identifying misinformation in real-world news content.
